# MTG DISCOVERY - TDD'd
This is using the MTG Discovery site as a canvas to experiment with better ways of working. To develop habits and tools that improve my ability to do the right thing when working in code.

## The Right Things
The things I want to use and improve are
* TDD. It's a muscle; gotta work it.
* Arlo's Commit Notation. I like it. Mostly I like small commits. It helps.
* Tooling. This is multi-part. 
* * While nCrunch is great... can I get away with something else...
* * TC||R - I want to use this effectively; so gotta use it ineffectiveley.
* * Making it easier to do Arlo's Commit Notation
